Hook up a DDR pad to your computer and use it to do stuff while you code.

Even better than a standing desk, it's a dancing desk!



Depends on pygame to read input, latest install instructions are here:

The pad and adapter I was using were http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GF7KAW/
and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AATQ0Y/ though I wouldn't recommend that
adapter for use with a DDR pad if you want to actually play DDR.
